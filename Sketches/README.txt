	The arm robots main purpose is going to be flipping cards on a table. It has curves that meatch up so that it is visually appealing. the base is unmoving, but there is a cylender in the center to allow the arm to swivle around. There are double lense camera's on both sides near the "Wrist" so that the arm can visually see what cards need to be flipped. The finger tips are made of thin metal so that the cards can slip into it's grasp easier. The metal will look gold of aesthetics.
