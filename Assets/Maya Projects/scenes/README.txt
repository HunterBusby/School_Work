I decided to put the forearm on the side as opposed to the middle because movement would be restrained if it was in the middle. I fleshed out the shape of the fingers and the finger tips. I added another joint so that there is more movement possibilities in the wrist area. I also gave the main arms 'Bicep' and 'forearm' some depth to it for style.

-- I realized the wrist movement looked weird without giving it space in the arm so I cut it out.
