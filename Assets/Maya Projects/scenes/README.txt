Uvmapping and surfacing went well. Had a little problem with the gear having nonmanifold geometry that was unfixable, but the UV looked good so I didn't mess around with it. It is possible to have multiple texture groups in Sketchfab, you just have to select each different group and assign it's different maps (Normal, height, base) so it's just a little tideous.
